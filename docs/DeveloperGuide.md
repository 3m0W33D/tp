## 1. Introduction

**Welcome to TermiNUS!**

**TermiNUS** is a CLI (command line interface) program for NUS Students who wish to organize their
NUS academic materials through a CLI. The product aims to aid student in organizing their academic
schedule and enhancing their learning experiences.

**TermiNUS** is written in **Java 11** and uses the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm which
provides us with means to structure a software program into organized and reusable pieces of codes,
making it more efficient for future improvements and revisions.

### 1.1 Purpose

This developer guide is for any developers who wish to contribute to **TermiNUS**. It contains the
overall architecture design of **TermiNUS** and it displays our main features implementation details
with the rationale and consideration for each. As of now, the guide is written for the current
release version of `TermiNUS of v1.0`.

### 1.2 Using this Guide

Insert legends / special icons used here to aid in the guide later.

## 2. Setting up

### 2.1 Setting up the project in your computer

#### 2.1.1 Prerequisite

Before setting up the project, please do ensure you have the following items installed.

- [JDK 11](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html)
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)

`Java Development Kit ver 11 (JDK 11)` is the **environment / programming language** in which
TermiNUS is written with and `IntelliJ IDEA` will be the **integrated development environment (
IDE)** platform for us to write the programming codes on.

#### 2.1.2 Getting the project files

Go to [link](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T10-2/tp) and retrieve the `TermiNUS project file`.
You can do so by **forking** the project and **cloning** a copy into your computer.

To learn more about github fork-clone feature please follow the guide
on [link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

#### 2.1.3 Setting up on IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open the application `IntelliJ IDEA`.
2. Inside `IntelliJ IDEA` navigate to `open project` button
    1. On the top left of the app, `File`&rarr;`Open...`
3. Locate and select the folder containing the files for **Terminus** that you have downloaded
   earlier on.
4. Change the **Project SDK** that IntelliJ IDEA will be using.
    1. On the top left of the app, `File`&rarr;`Project Structure...`
    2. Under **Project SDK:** section, find and select JDK version 11.
       Eg: `Amazon Corretto version 11.0.12`.
    3. Under **Project language level:**, select `SDK default`.
5. Verifying the setup
    1. After performing the steps above, locate the file `src/main/java/terminus/Terminus.java`,
       right-click and select `Run 'Terminus.main()'`.
    2. If everything is correctly set up, you should see the following terminal.
   ```
   Welcome to TermiNUS!
   
   Type any of the following to get started:
   > exit
   > help
   > note
   > schedule
   
   [] >>>

   ```

#### 2.1.4 Configuring the Coding Style

Import the coding style xml file into your IntelliJ IDEA.

1. Go to IntelliJ IDEA settings page.
    1. Located at the **top-right** of the app, click on the gear icon and select `Settings...`.
2. Under the settings page, locate the `Code Style` tab.
    1. `Editor`&rarr;`Code Style`
3. Once you are at the `Code Style` tab, you will need to import the file `CS2113TStyle.xml`.
    1. At the `Scheme` section, select the gear icon and select `Import Scheme`
       &rarr;`IntelliJ IDEA code style XML`.
    2. Locate and select the `CS2113TStyle.xml` file which is included in the TermiNUS project.
    3. Once done, select `Apply` then `OK`.
4. Now your IntelliJ IDEA should follow our Coding Style.

> :bulb: IntelliJ IDEA have certain shortcut key to aid in auto-formatting of code. 
> Once you are done with a piece of code, highlight the section you have just written and press the 
> key `CTRL + SHIFT + L`.

## 3. Design

### 3.1 Architecture

### 3.2 UI Component

### 3.3 Parser Component

### 3.4 Command Component
 
### 3.5 Module Component
![](attachments/Module.png)

The Module Components consists of the `ModuleManager` which contains a collection of `NusModule` and
maps a module name to a specific `NusModule`.
The `NusModule` consist of `ContentManager` which help to manage `Link` and `Note`. 
The `ContentManager` accepts a `Content` type generic
and manages an `ArrayList` of `Content` either being a `Note` or a `Link`.

The `ModuleManager`
- add,delete or retrieve a specific `NusModule`
- list all module names

### 3.6 Content Component

### 3.7 Active Recall Component

### 3.8 Storage Component
