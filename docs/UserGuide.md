## Introduction

TermiNUS is a CLI (command line interface) program for NUS Students who wish to consolidate their
NUS academic materials such as zoom links, questions and notes for the modules that they are taking.
With TermiNUS, it aims to aid Students and improve their learning experiences while studying in NUS.

## Purpose

This documents aims to provide you with instruction on how to use `TermiNUS` and tips & tricks
included to improve your experiences while using it. The document will bring you through a detailed
guide on all existing commands as well as aiding you in installing `TerminNUS`.

---

## Using this Guide

Along the way, you might encounter commands with specific brackets around some values such as `{}`
and `<>`.

The below table represents what each means.

| Command options | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `{value}` |  The value is optional, and including it may provide different results.|
| `<value>` | The value is required for the command to work properly.|
|`"<value>"`| Some command have `""` quotes in it, this is required for the command to work properly. For example, `add "<value>"` would need to be `add "something"`.|
|`index`|A number identifying an item in TermiNUS. This index can only be viewed using the `view` command.|
|`start_time`|The `start time` must be in a **HH:mm** format which follows the **24-hour notation**. For example, `14:20` is valid which represents `2:20 pm`.|
|`day`|The `day` must be a day spelled out fully. For example, `Monday`, `Tuesday`, `Wednesday`, `Thursday`, `Friday`, `Saturday` and `Sunday` are the only **7** valid days.|
|`duration`|The `duration` must be a **positive** number and upon addition with `start_time`, it must not exceed the 24-hour limit of the day. For example, if `start_time` is `21:00`, `2` is a valid `duration` but `-1` and `4` are not.|

Terminologies used throughout this guide:

| Terminology | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| workspace |  A workspace is the environment in which you are currently assessing. For example, when you want to access some files inside a folder, you will need to enter the folder first. As such the folder is a **workspace**.|
|workspace indicator|A workspace indicator shows the current workspace you are currently in when using `TermiNUS`. For example, in the expected output for commands, you will be able to see `[] >>>` which means you are in the **default workspace**, `[module] >>>` which means you are in the **module management workspace**. etc.|
|default workspace|The very first workspace when executing the `TermiNUS` program. For example, `[] >>>` indicates you are currently in the **default workspace**.|
|module|A module refers to a NUS module. For example, `CS2113T` is a module.|

Icons used throughout this guide:

> ‚ö†Ô∏èA caution that you have to keep in mind when using the command.

> üí° Take note when you see this icon, as it might tell you something important.

> ‚ùó Important things you should take note of before using the command.

Lastly, text that is blue like this example, are clickable [links](#test) that will bring you to the 
relevant part of this user guide.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure that you
   have [Java 11](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html) or
   above installed.
2. Download the latest version of `TermiNUS.jar`
   from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T10-2/tp/releases/).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use for `TermiNUS`.
    1. This is because `TermiNUS` will store all its saved data in the folder it is currently in.
4. Open your command prompt and go into the folder containing the `TermiNUS.jar` file.
    1. You can do so by `win + R` and run `cmd`.
    2. Next, a console will appear, type in the following `cd C:/folder` where `folder` is the
       folder containing the `TermiNUS.jar` file.
5. Next to run `TermiNUS`, in the command prompt type in `java -jar TermiNUS.jar`.
6. When you first start the `TermiNUS`, you will be greeted with our banner:

    ```
    Welcome to TermiNUS!
    You have no schedule for today.
    
    Type any of the following to get started:
    > exit
    > help
    > module
    > go
    > timetable
    
    [] >>>  
    ```

7. To get started, you can run the following commands:

    - module
    - go
    - timetable
    - help
    - exit
8. For more information of each command, please refer to the [Features](#section-note) below.

## Quick guide to using TermiNUS

1. Before adding any **note**, **schedule** and **question**, we will need to have a **module** first in which these items belong to.
2. You can do so by adding a module within the **module management workspace**. Please refer to: [Section: Module Management](#section-module-management).
3. After adding a module, you can proceed to add items such as **note**, **schedule** and **question** into it.
4. But firstly you will need to enter the **module workspace** in which you have just created. Please refer to: [Section: Module](#section-module).
5. Once entering the **module workspace**, you can add the items related to the module here.
    1. Please refer to [Section: Note](#section-note) for any related **Note** item.
    2. Please refer to [Section: Schedule](#section-schedule) for any related **Schedule** item.
    3. Please refer to [Section: Question](#section-question) for any related **Question** item.
6. Once you are done, you can exit **TermiNUS** using the `exit` command.

Hope you enjoy your experience with TermiNUS!

Question:
What is EP?

When you are ready, press [Enter] to continue.
```

After revealing the answer, provide feedback to TermiNUS to allow it to know if the question should
appear more often in the future.

- Key in `1` if you felt it was easy.
- Key in `2` if you felt it was normal.
- Key in `3` if you felt it was hard.
- Key in `E` if you wish to exit the session.

```
You took 172 seconds to reveal the answer.

Answer:
Equivalence partitioning

How did you find the question? (Compare against past attempts if any)
[1] Easy; [2] Normal / Same; [3] Hard; [E] Exit
[1/2/3/E] >> 
```

After choosing your difficulty, you may proceed to reveal the next question by pressing
<kbd>Enter</kbd> key again.

```
[1/2/3/E] >> 2

When you are ready, press [Enter] to continue.
```

Once the question pool is empty, or when you decided to stop, TermiNUS will drop you back into the

Returns to the previous workspace prior to the current workspace you are in.

> üí° The **default** workspace is the only workspace that has no `back` command. This is because this workspace is the very first workspace of TermiNUS.

Example: `back` from note workspace

Expected Output:

```
[CS2113T > note] >>> back

Entering CS2113T workspace

Type any of the following to get started:
> exit
> help
> note
> schedule

[] >>> 
```

## Advanced Usage of Commands

**Format:** `<workspace> <available workspace command>`

Users can access workspace command directly without entering its environment. Seen below are some
command examples.

A workspace command is a command that will bring you to its own workspace. Current workspace command
includes note, schedule, question, and module.

> üí° To access the module in TermiNUS, you will need to use the `go` command. For more information, please refer to [Section: Module](#section-module).

> ‚ö†Ô∏èThis advance command do not allow any chaining with the `back` command.

Example:

- Adding a note without entering the note workspace.

```
[CS2113T] >>> note add "Advance command"  "Advance command is cool"
Your note on 'Advance command' has been added!
[CS2113T] >>> 
```

- Adding a schedule without entering the schedule workspace.

```
[CS2113T] >>> schedule add "Lecture" "Friday" "16:00" "2" "https://zoom.us/test"
Your schedule on 'Lecture' has been added!
[CS2113T] >>> 
```

- Adding a question without entering the module workspace.

```
[] >>> go CS2113T question add "What is Java?" "It is a programming language."
Your question on 'What is Java?' has been added!
[] >>> 
```

## FAQ
**Q:** Can I edit the information in the`data` directory?  
**A:** Yes! **TermiNUS** saves and loads your information form the `data` directory, editing the files
in the `data` folder works. We recommend that you update the **contents** of any notes `.txt` in the 
`data/module_name` directory. However, we do not recommend modifying any configuration file 
or renaming any file/folders. You should use **TermiNUS** instead to edit any information.
