## Overview
TermiNUS is a CLI (command line interface) program for NUS Students who wish to consolidate their
NUS academic materials such as zoom links, questions and notes for the modules that they are taking.
It is written in Java, and has about 12 kLoC.

### Summary of Contributions
* **New Feature:** Added the ability to parse user commands to execute the required actions
  * What it does: Allows parsing of the user input so that the program knows what action to perform. The feature must also support multi-step commands and oneshot commands simutaneously.  
  * Justification: Being able to parse multi-step commands and oneshot commands allows for catering to advance users as well as new users. The key functionality is that regardless of multi-step or oneshot, the user should be able perform the intended action accurately so that they manage their academic material better.
  * Highlights: The challenge in this implementation, is ensuring that a single command parser can handle multiple styles of parsing, while ensuring the same functionality. Other addition constraints was that a switch statement would not suffice for a dynamic parsing system as the arguments could always differ. With all of these in consideration, we implmemented the parsing system using a HashMap instead. This however, brought about certain limitations such as having a Common Command class and arguments could not be initalized in the constructor of the specific Command.
